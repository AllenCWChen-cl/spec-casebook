## rule

### KP-007 A failed generation refunds its credits (authority team, unverified)
A failed item costs nothing net; a partial failure costs only the items that succeeded. A missing or wrong refund is
a defect with its own eBug, even when the failure itself is already filed.

## question

### KP-028 No Design for the notification centre
No Design sheet covers the notification centre. Open for PM/Design: what 「Try Now」 may open (external sites, a mark
or confirmation), per-entry unread state, multi-open accordions, refresh frequency and paging.

### KP-037 VIP or Pro+
The top tier is called 「VIP」 on the Mine card and in Design F13 but 「Pro+」 on the My Cloud storage badge, the
paywall and Design F14/F17 (which also draw the subscribed bottom tab as 「Pro+」; the build keeps 「Mine」). Whether
they are one tier is for PM (ISS-MP-25); don't file the mix as a defect meanwhile.

### KP-061 Completion and error states the specs leave open
CineStory F17 says inform users 「when the task is done」 without saying server-done or downloaded. The banner button
is 「View」 in CineStory F02 and 「View Result」 in Video Object Removal F116 (the build says View). The F15 error
states 「Retry」 and 「View Details」 were never reached.

## fact

### KP-003 Android debug controls (android)
Android has no Pink, no fault switches, no tier switch, no Write Log and no developer-server switch. Launcher ☰ ›
Menu ends with a QA block (download all contents, scoped-storage migration, 「QA: consume all non-consumables」, 「QA:
show all subscription plans」, 「QA: purchase SKU test」, region): never tap the consume or purchase rows. Fault
switches are planned for a later build (user, 2026-10-28): recheck on each new build.

### KP-006 Android tiers and chat limits (android, unverified)
Android sells Pro, not Pro+, through Google Play billing; the tier comes from the signed-in account. Daily chat limits
are server-configured: Free 10, Pro 100.

### KP-011 Design 8/E is the leading Launcher sheet (unverified)
Of the Launcher Design sheets, 「Template Page - Launcher supports banner (TBD) (8_E)」 matches the build (three content
rows, five bottom tabs, 「View more」). Older sheets drawing 「See All」, four tabs or two rows are superseded: never
file against them. The big-shortcut list follows 8/E F14 (…Video Enhance), not F04 (…Cinematic Reel Creator).

### KP-012 Shortcut tiles come from the CMS (unverified)
Which tools the Launcher's small shortcuts show (and in what order) is set on the CMS (Design: 「Shortcut on CMS」), up to
16 tiles over two pages. A tile list that differs from the Design is not a defect; reach a tool through AI Magic when
it is not on the first page.

## term

### KF-006 The jobs the feature runs
Outline, characters, Create my character, chat revision, storyboard, scene image and Location, chat image update,
Storyboard Preview, scene video, video regeneration, full video, captions, download/export. These are the rows of the
Job states grid.

### KP-023 Meme Dance Creator
The Launcher's second row is 「Meme Dance Creator」 in the build. Design 8/E and the more-content-promotion sheet also
say 「Meme Dance Generator」; use the build's name and don't file the difference (a spec self-contradiction for PM).

### KP-038 Advanced Cutout and AI Smart Cutout
One capability: the Mine Free card calls it 「Advanced Cutout」, the paywall's Compare plans 「AI Smart Cutout」.
